Snake JS
========
Snake JS is a **one player simple 2D-game** written *purely in JavaScript* (without any frameworks). It is playable in modern web browsers. It is inspired by [the classical video game Snake][1] which could be played on some Nokia cell phones from the 90's. It uses the HTML5 canvas element for rendering.

Demo
----
Play the game on my [personal website][4]. There is also a highscore feature there.

Instructions
------------
To play the game, just open **&lt;index.html&gt;** in your favourite modern gecko- or webkit-based web browser like Firefox, Safari or Chrome.

Purpose
-------
This purpose of Snake JS is (in this order)

1.	to explore, discuss and practise good OOP design
	in a simple and naked JavaScript-based environment,
2.	to adapt new web techniques, like the HTML5 canvas element
3.	to create an extremely entertaining game.

The purpose is **not** to make the game cross-browser compatible. Hacks and inconsistensies are only applied when absolutely necessary.
